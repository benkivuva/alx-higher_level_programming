# Project Title

0x02. Python - Import & Modules

## Description

In this project, we learned about Python modules and how to import them into our scripts. We also learned how to create our own modules and use them in our programs. We covered topics such as importing modules using `import`, `from`, and `as`, as well as the `dir()` function and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement.

## Directory

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `0-add.py` | A program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`. |
| `1-calculation.py` | A program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, does some math, and prints the result. |
| `2-args.py` | A program that prints the number of and list of its arguments. |
| `3-infinite_add.py` | A program that prints the sum of all its arguments. |
| `4-hidden_discovery.py` | A program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`. |
| `5-variable_load.py` | A program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value. |
| `100-my_calculator.py` | A program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations. |
| `101-easy_print.py` | A program that prints `#pythoniscool` without using `print`, `eval`, `open`, or `sys`. |
| `102-magic_calculation.py` | A Python function that replicates the given bytecode. |
| `103-fast_alphabet.py` | A program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a newline. |
